# TML-SDProperty

Translation metalanguage of source document properties has been developed in the TNTC project supported by the JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (S) 19H05660: [Developing a Translation Process Model and Constructing an Integrated Translation Environment Through Detailed Descriptions of Translation Norms and Competences](https://tntc.p.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/).

## Contents

* TML-SDProperty-v1-EN (xlsx)
    * Typology: Property values (options/examples) are extracted from House (1977, 1997, as cited in House, 2014), ISO  (2012), Newmark (1988), Nord (2005), Reiss (1971/2000), Reiss and Vermeer (1991/2013), and Snell-Hornby (1995).

## Author

TML-SDProperty-v1-EN was developed by Rei Miyata and Takuya Miyauchi. The details of its development are described in Miyata and Miyauchi (2022) and Miyata (2022).

The Excel file for download was created by Rei Miyata.

## Acknowledgements

The developers are grateful to Kyo Kageura for discussions on the notion and role of documents in translation and Hui Piao for her insightful comments on the application of the metalanguage.
